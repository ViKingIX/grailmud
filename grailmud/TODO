====================================
The stuff what does need doing
====================================

For 0.1
=======

* Test ``telnet.py``, ``objects.py``, ``listeners.py`` and ``rooms.py`` as
completely as possible.

* Test ``actiondefs/login.py`` and ``actiondefs/logoff.py`` a bit.

* Go through the XXXes and TODOs in the code and organise them a bit, and list
them here if they're major.

For 0.2
=======

* A proper object relational integrity system, possibly with querying. There is
prior art here; SQLAlchemy, SQLObject, ZCatalog, et al.

* An OLC system.

* A timeout mechanism, to drop idle connections.

* A way of stopping double-logins.

* Case auditing in user commands, and possibly the use of a LoweredKeyDict.

Just nice to have
=================

* More documentation. Particularly, tutorials and high-level descriptions might
be nice.

* Renaming of names! 'Listener' to 'Delegate', and sorting out the hodge-podge
of camelCase method and function names.
